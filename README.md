# Lending-Club-Case-Study
This is an EDA Project. In this project we are analysing the data given by lending club. Our goal is to find out what are the characteristics of defaulters and how we can avoid giving loans to them and help investors take better decisions. We also want to make sure that we don't reject any capable candidate and lose out on interest.
